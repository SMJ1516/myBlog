    <h3> Step 1: Arrange the carroms
Arrange the carroms in a hexagon at the center of the board with the red queen in the center. 
      
      <br> <br>

Step 2: Flip a coin
Flip a coin to determine which player goes first. The winner plays the white carroms.
<br> <br>
Step 3: Take a seat
Seat yourself at one side of the board. You will only be allowed to initiate carrom strikes from that side of the board.
<br> <br>
Step 4: Try to sink your carroms
Move the striker with your fingers from your baseline as you try to sink your carroms. Your turn continues as long as you continue to sink carroms.
<br> <br>
Step 5: Try to sink the red queen
When you have sunk one of your carroms, try to sink the red queen. 
<br> <br>
Tip
If you sink the red queen, you must sink one of your carroms on the next shot. Otherwise the queen is returned to the center of the board.
<br> <br>
Step 6: Continue the game
Continue the game until one player has sunk all of their carroms and the red queen has been sunk. That player is the winner of the game.

The first international carroms match was held in the 1960s, when a team from India competed against one from Sri Lanka.</h3>

    <h3>My Favourite Hobby is Playing Carrom Board. Carrom-Men is a tabletop game of Indian Origin which is played by 4 players. Carrom-Men is quite a simple game. I like Carrom-Men because it's a family friendly board game.The genre of this game is strategy. You need good aiming for the game. For this game you will also need talcum powder so that the pieces for this game can slide around the board easily. I would recommend this game to any person of the age 6+. This is one of my favourite board games which can be played with family, friends etc.) It does not require as much thinking as the masterpiece game chess, but it does still require a lot of thinking and concentration. This game is very popular in South Asia, and is known by various names in different languages. Carrom Men is very commonly played by families, including children, and at social functions. Overall, it's a very fun and intellegent game. It is a game which does not waste time.</h3>
